# Elly Chat

## Description

Elly Chat is an homage to the pioneering chatbot ELIZA and aims to further push the boundaries of AI in mental health assistance. The project is focused on developing a mental health chatbot app that serves as both a friend and a virtual assistant. It will track and record various metrics like sleep habits, eating habits, and mood fluctuations, with the ultimate goal of helping users manage their mental health. This project was developed with assistance from OpenAI's ChatGPT.
